# OncologyPro

## Project Overview
This project implements **K-Means Clustering** in **C++** to segment the lesion area from a given **skin cancer image**. The program reads an image, applies K-Means clustering to classify pixels into different clusters, and isolates the lesion region.

## Features
- Loads an image using OpenCV
- Converts the image into a feature space suitable for clustering
- Applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment the lesion
- Displays and saves the segmented output

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **C++ Compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **CMake** (if building with CMake)
